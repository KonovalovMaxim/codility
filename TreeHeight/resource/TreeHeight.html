        <p>In this problem we consider binary trees, represented by pointer data structures.</p>
        <p>A <i>binary tree</i> is either an empty tree or a node (called the <i>root</i>) consisting of a single
            integer value and two further binary trees, called the <i>left subtree</i> and the <i>right subtree</i>.</p>
        <p>For example, the figure below shows a binary tree consisting of six nodes. Its root contains the value 5, and
            the roots of its left and right subtrees have the values 3 and 10, respectively. The right subtree of the
            node containing the value 10, as well as the left and right subtrees of the nodes containing the values 20,
            21 and 1, are empty trees.</p>
        <p>

        </p>
        <p>A <i>path</i> in a binary tree is a non-empty sequence of nodes that one can traverse by following the
            pointers. The <i>length</i> of a path is the number of pointers it traverses. More formally, a path of
            length K is a sequence of nodes P[0], P[1], ..., P[K], such that node P[I + 1] is the root of the left or
            right subtree of P[I], for 0 ≤ I &lt; K. For example, the sequence of nodes with values 5, 3, 21 is a path
            of length 2 in the tree from the above figure. The sequence of nodes with values 10, 1 is a path of length
            1. The sequence of nodes with values 21, 3, 20 is not a valid path.</p>
        <p>The <i>height</i> of a binary tree is defined as the length of the longest possible path in the tree. In
            particular, a tree consisting of only one node has height 0 and, conventionally, an empty tree has height
            −1. For example, the tree shown in the above figure is of height 2.</p>
        <p></p>
        <h2>Problem</h2>
        <p>Write a function:</p>
        <blockquote><p class="lang-java"
                       style="font-family: monospace; font-size: 9pt; display: block; white-space: pre-wrap"><tt>class
            Solution { public int solution(Tree T); }</tt></p></blockquote>
        <p>that, given a non-empty binary tree T consisting of N nodes, returns its height. For example, given tree T
            shown in the figure above, the function should return 2, as explained above. Note that the values contained
            in the nodes are not relevant in this task.</p>
        <p></p>
        <h2>Technical details</h2>
        <p>A binary tree can be given using a pointer data structure. Assume that the following declarations are
            given:</p>
        <blockquote><p class="lang-java"
                       style="font-family: monospace; font-size: 9pt; display: block; white-space: pre-wrap"><tt>class
            Tree {
            public int x;
            public Tree l;
            public Tree r;
            }</tt></p></blockquote>
        <p>An empty tree is represented by an empty pointer (denoted by <tt style="white-space:pre-wrap">null</tt>). A
            non-empty tree is represented by a pointer to an object representing its root. The attribute <tt
                    style="white-space:pre-wrap">x</tt> holds the integer contained in the root, whereas attributes <tt
                    style="white-space:pre-wrap">l</tt> and <tt style="white-space:pre-wrap">r</tt> hold the left and
            right subtrees of the binary tree, respectively.</p>
        <p>For the purpose of entering your own test cases, you can denote a tree recursively in the following way. An
            empty binary tree is denoted by <tt style="white-space:pre-wrap">None</tt>. A non-empty tree is denoted as
            (X, L, R), where X is the value contained in the root and L and R denote the left and right subtrees,
            respectively. The tree from the above figure can be denoted as:</p>
        <tt style="white-space:pre-wrap"> (5, (3, (20, None, None), (21, None, None)), (10, (1, None, None), None))</tt>
        <p></p>
        <h2>Assumptions</h2>
        <p>Assume that:</p>
        <blockquote>
            <ul style="margin: 10px;padding: 0px;">
                <li>N is an integer within the range [<span class="number">1</span>..<span class="number">1,000</span>];
                </li>
                <li>the height of tree T (number of edges on the longest path from root to leaf) is within the range
                    [<span class="number">0</span>..<span class="number">500</span>].
                </li>
            </ul>
        </blockquote>
        <p>Complexity:</p>
        <blockquote>
            <ul style="margin: 10px;padding: 0px;">
                <li>expected worst-case time complexity is O(N);</li>
                <li>expected worst-case space complexity is O(N).</li>
            </ul>
