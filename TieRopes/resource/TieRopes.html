        <p>There are N ropes numbered from 0 to N − 1, whose lengths are given in a zero-indexed array A, lying on the
            floor in a line. For each I (0 ≤ I &lt; N), the length of rope I on the line is A[I].</p>
        <p>We say that two ropes I and I + 1 are <i>adjacent</i>. Two adjacent ropes can be tied together with a knot,
            and the length of the tied rope is the sum of lengths of both ropes. The resulting new rope can then be tied
            again.</p>
        <p>For a given integer K, the goal is to tie the ropes in such a way that the number of ropes whose length is
            greater than or equal to K is maximal.</p>
        <p>For example, consider K = 4 and array A such that:</p>
        <tt style="white-space:pre-wrap"> A[0] = 1
            A[1] = 2
            A[2] = 3
            A[3] = 4
            A[4] = 1
            A[5] = 1
            A[6] = 3</tt>
        <p>The ropes are shown in the figure below.</p>
        <p>

        </p>
        <p>We can tie:</p>
        <blockquote>
            <ul style="margin: 10px;padding: 0px;">
                <li>rope 1 with rope 2 to produce a rope of length A[1] + A[2] = 5;</li>
                <li>rope 4 with rope 5 with rope 6 to produce a rope of length A[4] + A[5] + A[6] = 5.</li>
            </ul>
        </blockquote>
        <p>After that, there will be three ropes whose lengths are greater than or equal to K = 4. It is not possible to
            produce four such ropes.</p>
        <p>Write a function:</p>
        <blockquote><p class="lang-java"
                       style="font-family: monospace; font-size: 9pt; display: block; white-space: pre-wrap"><tt>class
            Solution { public int solution(int K, int[] A); }</tt></p></blockquote>
        <p>that, given an integer K and a non-empty zero-indexed array A of N integers, returns the maximum number of
            ropes of length greater than or equal to K that can be created.</p>
        <p>For example, given K = 4 and array A such that:</p>
        <tt style="white-space:pre-wrap"> A[0] = 1
            A[1] = 2
            A[2] = 3
            A[3] = 4
            A[4] = 1
            A[5] = 1
            A[6] = 3</tt>
        <p>the function should return 3, as explained above.</p>
        <p>Assume that:</p>
        <blockquote>
            <ul style="margin: 10px;padding: 0px;">
                <li>N is an integer within the range [<span class="number">1</span>..<span class="number">100,000</span>];
                </li>
                <li>K is an integer within the range [<span class="number">1</span>..<span
                        class="number">1,000,000,000</span>];
                </li>
                <li>each element of array A is an integer within the range [<span class="number">1</span>..<span
                        class="number">1,000,000,000</span>].
                </li>
            </ul>
        </blockquote>
        <p>Complexity:</p>
        <blockquote>
            <ul style="margin: 10px;padding: 0px;">
                <li>expected worst-case time complexity is O(N);</li>
                <li>expected worst-case space complexity is O(N), beyond input storage (not counting the storage
                    required for input arguments).
                </li>
            </ul>
        </blockquote>
        <p>Elements of input arrays can be modified.</p>
