<div id="brinza-task-description">
    <p>Located on a line are N segments, numbered from 0 to N − 1, whose positions are given in zero-indexed arrays A
        and B. For each I (0 ≤ I &lt; N) the position of segment I is from A[I] to B[I] (inclusive). The segments are
        sorted by their ends, which means that B[K] ≤ B[K + 1] for K such that 0 ≤ K &lt; N − 1.</p>
    <p>Two segments I and J, such that I ≠ J, are <i>overlapping</i> if they share at least one common point. In other
        words, A[I] ≤ A[J] ≤ B[I] or A[J] ≤ A[I] ≤ B[J].</p>
    <p>We say that the set of segments is <i>non-overlapping</i> if it contains no two overlapping segments. The goal is
        to find the size of a non-overlapping set containing the maximal number of segments.</p>
    <p>For example, consider arrays A, B such that:</p>
    <tt style="white-space:pre-wrap"> A[0] = 1 B[0] = 5
        A[1] = 3 B[1] = 6
        A[2] = 7 B[2] = 8
        A[3] = 9 B[3] = 9
        A[4] = 9 B[4] = 10</tt>
    <p>The segments are shown in the figure below.</p>

    </p>
    <p>The size of a non-overlapping set containing a maximal number of segments is 3. For example, possible sets are
        {0, 2, 3}, {0, 2, 4}, {1, 2, 3} or {1, 2, 4}. There is no non-overlapping set with four segments.</p>
    <p>Write a function:</p>
    <blockquote><p class="lang-java"
                   style="font-family: monospace; font-size: 9pt; display: block; white-space: pre-wrap"><tt>class
        Solution { public int solution(int[] A, int[] B); }</tt></p></blockquote>
    <p>that, given two zero-indexed arrays A and B consisting of N integers, returns the size of a non-overlapping set
        containing a maximal number of segments.</p>
    <p>For example, given arrays A, B shown above, the function should return 3, as explained above.</p>
    <p>Assume that:</p>
    <blockquote>
        <ul style="margin: 10px;padding: 0px;">
            <li>N is an integer within the range [<span class="number">0</span>..<span class="number">30,000</span>];
            </li>
            <li>each element of arrays A, B is an integer within the range [<span class="number">0</span>..<span
                    class="number">1,000,000,000</span>];
            </li>
            <li>A[I] ≤ B[I], for each I (0 ≤ I &lt; N);</li>
            <li>B[K] ≤ B[K + 1], for each K (0 ≤ K &lt; N − 1).</li>
        </ul>
    </blockquote>
    <p>Complexity:</p>
    <blockquote>
        <ul style="margin: 10px;padding: 0px;">
            <li>expected worst-case time complexity is O(N);</li>
            <li>expected worst-case space complexity is O(N), beyond input storage (not counting the storage required
                for input arguments).
            </li>
        </ul>
    </blockquote>
    <p>Elements of input arrays can be modified.</p>
