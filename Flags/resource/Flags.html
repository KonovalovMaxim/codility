        <p>A non-empty zero-indexed array A consisting of N integers is given.</p>
        <p>A <i>peak</i> is an array element which is larger than its neighbours. More precisely, it is an index P such
            that 0 &lt; P &lt; N − 1 and A[P − 1] &lt; A[P] &gt; A[P + 1].</p>
        <p>For example, the following array A:</p>
        <tt style="white-space:pre-wrap"> A[0] = 1
            A[1] = 5
            A[2] = 3
            A[3] = 4
            A[4] = 3
            A[5] = 4
            A[6] = 1
            A[7] = 2
            A[8] = 3
            A[9] = 4
            A[10] = 6
            A[11] = 2</tt>
        <p>has exactly four peaks: elements 1, 3, 5 and 10.</p>
        <p>You are going on a trip to a range of mountains whose relative heights are represented by array A, as shown
            in a figure below. You have to choose how many flags you should take with you. The goal is to set the
            maximum number of flags on the peaks, according to certain rules.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="https://codility-frontend-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/media/task_img/flags/media/auto/mpd4a55575fdd9738489d6c0b8b544f648.png">
        </p>
        <p>Flags can only be set on peaks. What's more, if you take K flags, then the distance between any two flags
            should be greater than or equal to K. The distance between indices P and Q is the absolute value |P −
            Q|.</p>
        <p>For example, given the mountain range represented by array A, above, with N = 12, if you take:</p>
        <blockquote>
            <ul style="margin: 10px;padding: 0px;">
                <li>two flags, you can set them on peaks 1 and 5;</li>
                <li>three flags, you can set them on peaks 1, 5 and 10;</li>
                <li>four flags, you can set only three flags, on peaks 1, 5 and 10.</li>
            </ul>
        </blockquote>
        <p>You can therefore set a maximum of three flags in this case.</p>
        <p>Write a function:</p>
        <blockquote><p class="lang-java"
                       style="font-family: monospace; font-size: 9pt; display: block; white-space: pre-wrap"><tt>class
            Solution { public int solution(int[] A); }</tt></p></blockquote>
        <p>that, given a non-empty zero-indexed array A of N integers, returns the maximum number of flags that can be
            set on the peaks of the array.</p>
        <p>For example, the following array A:</p>
        <tt style="white-space:pre-wrap"> A[0] = 1
            A[1] = 5
            A[2] = 3
            A[3] = 4
            A[4] = 3
            A[5] = 4
            A[6] = 1
            A[7] = 2
            A[8] = 3
            A[9] = 4
            A[10] = 6
            A[11] = 2</tt>
        <p>the function should return 3, as explained above.</p>
        <p>Assume that:</p>
        <blockquote>
            <ul style="margin: 10px;padding: 0px;">
                <li>N is an integer within the range [<span class="number">1</span>..<span class="number">400,000</span>];
                </li>
                <li>each element of array A is an integer within the range [<span class="number">0</span>..<span
                        class="number">1,000,000,000</span>].
                </li>
            </ul>
        </blockquote>
        <p>Complexity:</p>
        <blockquote>
            <ul style="margin: 10px;padding: 0px;">
                <li>expected worst-case time complexity is O(N);</li>
                <li>expected worst-case space complexity is O(N), beyond input storage (not counting the storage
                    required for input arguments).
                </li>
            </ul>
        </blockquote>
        <p>Elements of input arrays can be modified.</p>
