<div id="brinza-task-description">
    <p>You are given two non-empty zero-indexed arrays A and B consisting of N integers. These arrays represent N
        planks. More precisely, A[K] is the start and B[K] the end of the K−th plank.</p>
    <p>Next, you are given a non-empty zero-indexed array C consisting of M integers. This array represents M nails.
        More precisely, C[I] is the position where you can hammer in the I−th nail.</p>
    <p>We say that a plank (A[K], B[K]) is nailed if there exists a nail C[I] such that A[K] ≤ C[I] ≤ B[K].</p>
    <p>The goal is to find the minimum number of nails that must be used until all the planks are nailed. In other
        words, you should find a value J such that all planks will be nailed after using only the first J nails. More
        precisely, for every plank (A[K], B[K]) such that 0 ≤ K &lt; N, there should exist a nail C[I] such that I &lt;
        J and A[K] ≤ C[I] ≤ B[K].</p>
    <p>For example, given arrays A, B such that:</p>
    <tt style="white-space:pre-wrap"> A[0] = 1 B[0] = 4
        A[1] = 4 B[1] = 5
        A[2] = 5 B[2] = 9
        A[3] = 8 B[3] = 10</tt>
    <p>four planks are represented: [1, 4], [4, 5], [5, 9] and [8, 10].</p>
    <p>Given array C such that:</p>
    <tt style="white-space:pre-wrap"> C[0] = 4
        C[1] = 6
        C[2] = 7
        C[3] = 10
        C[4] = 2</tt>
    <p>if we use the following nails:</p>
    <blockquote>
        <ul style="margin: 10px;padding: 0px;">
            <li>0, then planks [1, 4] and [4, 5] will both be nailed.</li>
            <li>0, 1, then planks [1, 4], [4, 5] and [5, 9] will be nailed.</li>
            <li>0, 1, 2, then planks [1, 4], [4, 5] and [5, 9] will be nailed.</li>
            <li>0, 1, 2, 3, then all the planks will be nailed.</li>
        </ul>
    </blockquote>
    <p>Thus, four is the minimum number of nails that, used sequentially, allow all the planks to be nailed.</p>
    <p>Write a function:</p>
    <blockquote><p class="lang-java"
                   style="font-family: monospace; font-size: 9pt; display: block; white-space: pre-wrap"><tt>class
        Solution { public int solution(int[] A, int[] B, int[] C); }</tt></p></blockquote>
    <p>that, given two non-empty zero-indexed arrays A and B consisting of N integers and a non-empty zero-indexed array
        C consisting of M integers, returns the minimum number of nails that, used sequentially, allow all the planks to
        be nailed.</p>
    <p>If it is not possible to nail all the planks, the function should return −1.</p>
    <p>For example, given arrays A, B, C such that:</p>
    <tt style="white-space:pre-wrap"> A[0] = 1 B[0] = 4
        A[1] = 4 B[1] = 5
        A[2] = 5 B[2] = 9
        A[3] = 8 B[3] = 10

        C[0] = 4
        C[1] = 6
        C[2] = 7
        C[3] = 10
        C[4] = 2</tt>
    <p>the function should return 4, as explained above.</p>
    <p>Assume that:</p>
    <blockquote>
        <ul style="margin: 10px;padding: 0px;">
            <li>N and M are integers within the range [<span class="number">1</span>..<span class="number">30,000</span>];
            </li>
            <li>each element of arrays A, B, C is an integer within the range [<span class="number">1</span>..<span
                    class="number">2*M</span>];
            </li>
            <li>A[K] ≤ B[K].</li>
        </ul>
    </blockquote>
    <p>Complexity:</p>
    <blockquote>
        <ul style="margin: 10px;padding: 0px;">
            <li>expected worst-case time complexity is O((N+M)*log(M));</li>
            <li>expected worst-case space complexity is O(M), beyond input storage (not counting the storage required
                for input arguments).
            </li>
        </ul>
    </blockquote>
    <p>Elements of input arrays can be modified.</p>
